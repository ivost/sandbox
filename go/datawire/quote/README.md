# The (Obscure) Quote of the Moment Service

Minimal web service that is useful for experiments, tests, and demos. It is inspired by the 
[Datawire Quote of the Moment](https://github.com/datawire/qotm) service (which I also wrote years ago) but now 
rewritten in Go and with a slightly different API.
